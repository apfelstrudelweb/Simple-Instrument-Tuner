Red LEDs to the left indicate that you need to turn the peg away from you to avoid sounding  sharp - red LEDs to the right indicate that you need to turn the peg toward you to avoid sounding flat.";

Take as an example, the 'thick' E string of a guitar - in order to tune the E2 string, notice how both the tone 'E' within this gauge, and the octave '2' above are displayed.";
